# SpatialOmicsOverlay Workshop
## Bioconductor Smorgasbord 2023

This package is a template for building a Bioconductor workshop. The package

## Workshop Description
 This workshop will introduce users to the NanoString R package SpatialOmicsOverlay, which is useful in analyzing images from our GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (R) spatial biology platform.

This vignette demonstrates how to use OME-TIFF files generated by the NanoString GeoMx DSP instrument to enhance the data visualization for a NanoString GeoMx experiment. SpatialOmicsOverlay was specifically made to visualize and analyze the free-handed nature of Region of Interest (ROI) selection in a GeoMx experiment, and the immunofluorescence-guided segmentation process. The overlay from the instrument is recreated in the R environment allowing for plotting overlays with data like ROI type or gene expression.

 Participants will learn how to interact with OME-TIFF file types and generate informative plots over images. The vignette data is from our repository of GeoMx datasets, called the [Spatial Organ Atlas](https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/spatial-organ-atlas/). Each organ profiled in NanoStringâ€™s Spatial Organ Atlas (SOA) consists of freely available downloadable data files on 4-13 sections. For this vignette, users will be exploring the mouse brain.


## Resources
* [SpatialOmicsOverlay on Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialOmicsOverlay.html)
* [Spatial Organ Atlas data on NanoString's website](https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/spatial-organ-atlas/)
* [Source code](https://github.com/Nanostring-Biostats/SOOBiocWorkshop)
* [Learn more about the GeoMx DSP](https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/geomx-dsp-overview/)



## Pre-requisites
* Basic knowledge of R programming
* Docker
* Space on machine hosting Docker image to download a 13 GB demo data file
* Optional: familiarity with NanoString's DSP platform and data type. See *Resources* section.


## To Docker image:

```sh
docker run -e PASSWORD=<yourchosenpassword> -p 8787:8787 ghcr.io/nanostring-biostats/soobiocworkshop
```
Once running, navigate to http://localhost:8787/ and then login with `rstudio`:`<yourchosenpassword>`. 


*NOTE*: Running docker that uses the password in plain text like above exposes the password to others 
in a multi-user system (like a shared workstation or compute node). In practice, consider using an environment 
variable instead of plain text to pass along passwords and other secrets in docker command lines.
